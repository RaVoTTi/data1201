### Question 1: What happens when you swap the delimiter from commas to tabs? How does the preview change? 
(Make sure "disable live preview is not checked if you don't see a change)
The data changes the format because the file is csv, it means that is delimitated with ",". When we change the delimiter to a tab the program don't recognize the correct format for the file.
### Question 2: Try sorting the scientificName facet by name and by count. What problems are there with the data?
Some of the Scientific names are written with spaces. Moreover, I think that some of them are the same, but they are written wrongly.
### Question 3: Use faceting to figure out the following:
#### How many different years are represented in this file? 
16
#### What year occurs the most times?
1978
#### What year occurs the least number of times?
1993
### Question 4: What happens when you make a numerical facet of column note1, then convert the column to numbers? Is something different about the facet compared to yr?
Everything is white and the note1's facet says "not numeric value present". The main difference is the distribution of the data. Moreover, note1's facet has checkboxs that look like there are some kind of value that we can avoid or count like blank values.
### Question 5: Click and drag on the scatterplot facet you made to highlight a rectangle. What happens to the data points being displayed?
If I click and drag the data selected in the scatterplot is filter in the cells. In other words, we can filter data depending on what we select in the scatterplot.

### Question 6: After the last step, some columns are empty. (You can check by text faceting a column) Why? What do you think we can do to fix it?

I think that the problem is the spaces after and before the words. or maybe other words have two spaces instead of only one. that's why we see many empty columns. I think that we can trim the sentences before spliting
